## Before You Start

1. **Read the documentation**: 
   - For subagents: [Claude Code's subagent documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)
   - For commands: [Claude Code's slash commands documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
2. **Check existing contributions**: Ensure your idea doesn't overlap significantly with existing subagents or commands
3. **One purpose per contribution**: Each subagent or command should have a single, clear responsibility

## Contributing Subagents

### Creating a New Subagent

1. **Create your file** in the `subagents/` directory
2. **Name it appropriately**: `your-subagent-name.md`
3. **Follow the required structure** (see below)
4. **Test thoroughly** before submitting

### Subagent Structure

Every subagent MUST follow this exact structure:

```markdown
---
name: subagent-name
description: Clear, specific description of when this subagent should be invoked
category: category-name  # Required - see valid categories below
tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional - omit for all tools
---

You are a [role/expertise description].

When invoked:
1. [First action - analyze/understand requirements]
2. [Second action - identify patterns/structure]
3. [Third action - plan approach]
4. [Fourth action - begin implementation]
5. [Optional fifth action]

Process:
- [Key principle or methodology]
- [Best practice to follow]
- [Important consideration]
- [Quality standard]

Provide:
- [Specific deliverable with format]
- [Tests or validation]
- [Documentation or examples]
- [Performance or optimization notes]

[Optional: One-line emphasis on key principle or constraint]
```

### Field Requirements

#### Frontmatter (Required)

- **tools** (Optional):
  - Only include if restricting tools
  - Use comma-separated list
  - Common tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, Task

#### System Prompt Sections

> **Note on Formatting**: Section headers can be written with or without bold formatting. Both `**When invoked:**` and `When invoked:` are acceptable. Choose the style that best fits your documentation preferences.

1. **Opening Statement** (Required):
   - Start with "You are a..."
   - Define expertise in one sentence

2. **When invoked:** (Recommended):
   - Numbered list of immediate actions (1-5 items)
   - Action-oriented steps the subagent takes
   - Clear sequence of analysis and implementation

3. **Process:** (Recommended):
   - Bullet points describing methodology
   - Best practices and principles to follow
   - Focus on practical approaches

   - Specific outputs and formats
   - Include examples, tests, documentation

5. **Additional Instructions** (Optional):
   - Specific tools or technologies to use
   - Constraints or guidelines
   - One-line emphasis on key principles

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's
- ✅ Write clear, specific descriptions that help Claude Code know when to invoke
- ✅ Include concrete examples in the system prompt
- ✅ Use imperative mood ("Review code for...", not "Reviews code for...")
- ✅ Mention specific tools, frameworks, or technologies
- ✅ Include proactive triggers if appropriate ("Use immediately after...")
- ✅ Keep system prompts focused and under 500 lines
- ✅ Use markdown formatting for better readability

### Don'ts
- ❌ Create overlapping responsibilities with existing subagents
- ❌ Write vague or generic descriptions
- ❌ Include personal opinions or biases
- ❌ Use overly technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Create subagents for malicious purposes
- ❌ Include external URLs or references that might change

### Example of a Well-Written Subagent

```markdown
---
name: backend-architect
description: Design RESTful APIs, microservice boundaries, and database schemas. Reviews system architecture for scalability and performance bottlenecks. Use PROACTIVELY when creating new backend services or APIs.
category: development-architecture
---

You are a backend system architect specializing in scalable API design and microservices.

When invoked:
1. Analyze requirements and define clear service boundaries
2. Design APIs with contract-first approach
3. Create database schemas considering scaling requirements
4. Recommend technology stack with rationale
5. Identify potential bottlenecks and mitigation strategies

Process:
- Start with clear service boundaries and domain-driven design
- Design APIs contract-first with proper versioning and error handling
- Consider data consistency requirements across services
- Plan for horizontal scaling from day one
- Keep solutions simple and avoid premature optimization
- Focus on practical implementation over theoretical perfection

Provide:
-  API endpoint definitions with example requests/responses
-  Service architecture diagram (mermaid or ASCII)
-  Database schema with key relationships and indexes
-  Technology recommendations with brief rationale
-  Potential bottlenecks and scaling considerations
-  Caching strategies and performance optimization guidelines
-  Basic security patterns (authentication, rate limiting)

Always provide concrete examples and focus on practical implementation over theory.
```

### Testing Your Subagent

Before submitting, test your subagent:

1. **Installation Test**:
   ```bash
   cp subagents/your-subagent.md ~/.claude/agents/
   # Restart Claude Code
   ```

2. **Invocation Tests**:
   - Test automatic invocation with relevant prompts
   - Test explicit invocation: "Use the [subagent-name] to..."
   - Test @ mention: "@agent-[subagent-name] please help with..."

3. **Functionality Tests**:
   - Verify it performs its stated capabilities
   - Check tool usage if restricted
   - Ensure output matches specifications

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with ambiguous requests
   - Verify it doesn't activate inappropriately
   - Check interaction with other subagents

## Contributing Commands

### Creating a New Command

1. **Create your file** in the `commands/` directory
2. **Name it appropriately**: `your-command-name.md`
3. **Follow the required structure** (see below)
4. **Test the command** thoroughly

### Command Structure

Every command MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
---
description: Brief explanation of what the command does (10-200 chars)
category: category-name  # Required - see valid categories below
argument-hint: <optional-args>  # Optional - describe expected arguments
allowed-tools: tool1, tool2  # Optional - restrict tool usage
model: opus|sonnet|haiku  # Optional - specify model preference
---

# Command implementation

Detailed instructions for how the command should work...
```

#### Valid Command Categories:
- `ci-deployment` - CI/CD and deployment commands
- `code-analysis-testing` - Code quality and testing commands
- `context-loading-priming` - Context and priming commands
- `documentation-changelogs` - Documentation commands
- `project-task-management` - Project management commands
- `version-control-git` - Git and version control commands
- `miscellaneous` - Other specialized commands

### Testing Your Command

1. **Installation Test**:
   ```bash
   cp commands/your-command.md ~/.claude/commands/
   # Restart Claude Code
   ```

2. **Usage Tests**:
   - Test basic invocation: `/your_command`
   - Test with arguments: `/your_command arg1 arg2`
   - Verify error handling for invalid inputs

3. **Tool Restriction Tests**:
   - If you specified `allowed-tools`, verify only those tools are used
   - Test that restricted tools are not accessible

## File Naming Conventions

For both subagents and commands:

- **Format**: `descriptive-name.md`
- **Rules**:
  - Use lowercase letters only
  - Separate words with hyphens (-)
  - Be descriptive but concise
  - For subagents: Match the `name` field in frontmatter
  - For commands: Use underscores in the actual command (e.g., file `create-pr.md` becomes `/create_pr`)

**Good examples**:
- Subagents: `code-reviewer.md`, `python-pro.md`
- Commands: `create-pr.md`, `fix-issue.md`

**Bad examples**:
- `CodeReviewer.md` (wrong case)
- `code_reviewer.md` (underscores for subagents)
- `cr.md` (too vague)

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks** (see [How Automated Checks Work](#how-automated-checks-work)):
   - File naming conventions
   - Required structure validation
   - Markdown formatting
   - Frontmatter schema compliance
   - Duplicate name detection
   - Category validation

2. **Manual Review**:
   - Uniqueness and value proposition
   - Code quality and security
   - Documentation clarity
   - Integration with existing subagents

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Address reviewer comments
   - Make requested changes
   - Re-test after modifications

### Quality Standards

Your PR will be evaluated on:

- **Uniqueness**: Does it fill a genuine gap?
- **Clarity**: Is the purpose immediately clear?
- **Quality**: Is the system prompt well-written?
- **Integration**: Does it work well with other subagents?
- **Documentation**: Are examples and usage clear?
- **Security**: No malicious capabilities or prompts

### After Your PR is Merged

Once your pull request is approved and merged:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Your subagent or command will be automatically available on the [Web UI](https://www.buildwithclaude.com) within minutes
2. **No Manual Steps Required**: The deployment is handled automatically by Vercel
3. **Immediate Availability**: Users can browse, copy, or download your contribution from the website
4. **Repository Sync**: The web UI always displays the latest subagents and commands from the main branch

This means contributors don't need to worry about deployment - just focus on creating quality subagents and commands!

## How Automated Checks Work

Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically validates all contributions. Here's what gets checked:

### Validation Process

When you submit a PR, the following checks run automatically:

#### For Subagents:

1. **Frontmatter Validation**:
   - Validates YAML structure against our JSON schema
   - Ensures required fields (`name`, `description`, `category`) are present
   - Checks field formats (e.g., name must be lowercase with hyphens)

2. **File Naming**:
   - Verifies filename matches the `name` field exactly
   - Example: `code-reviewer.md` must have `name: code-reviewer`

3. **Content Checks**:
   - Ensures opening statement starts with "You are a..."
   - Validates description length (10-500 characters recommended)
   - Checks for duplicate names across all subagents

4. **Category Validation**:
   - Ensures category is one of the valid options

#### For Commands:

1. **Frontmatter Validation**:
   - Validates required fields (`description`, `category`)
   - Checks optional fields format (`argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, `model`)

2. **Content Validation**:
   - Ensures the command has implementation details
   - Validates description length (10-200 characters)

3. **Category Validation**:
   - Ensures category is one of the valid command categories

### Running Checks Locally

Before submitting your PR, run the validation locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install gray-matter ajv glob chalk

# Run validation for subagents
node scripts/validate-subagents.js

# Run validation for commands
node scripts/validate-commands.js
```

### Understanding Validation Output

The validator provides three types of feedback:

- **❌ Errors**: Must be fixed before merging
  - File name mismatches
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid frontmatter structure
  - Duplicate subagent names

- **⚠️  Warnings**: Should be addressed but won't block merging
  - Description too long (>500 characters)
  - Missing recommended sections
  - Unknown tool names

- **✅ Success**: All checks passed

### Example Output

```
Checking code-reviewer.md...
Checking python-pro.md...

Validation Report
==================================================

❌ Errors (1):
  - api-documenter.md: File name 'api-documentor.md' doesn't match name field 'api-documenter'. Expected 'api-documenter.md'

⚠️  Warnings (2):
  - complex-analyzer.md: Description is 500 characters (recommended: under 500)
  - new-subagent.md: Missing opening statement "You are a..."

❌ Validation failed!
```
