## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- # üöÄ MCP Server Support via Docker MCP Gateway

  ![MCP Servers](../buildwithclaude-mcps.png)

  Add Model Context Protocol (MCP) server support through secure Docker MCP Gateway integration with user and project scopes.

  ## New Features

  ### MCP Server Management (Docker Gateway Only)

  - **`bwc mcp list`** - Browse 100+ available MCP servers
  - **`bwc add --mcp <server>`** - Install servers via Docker MCP Gateway
  - **`bwc mcp search <query>`** - Find MCP servers by functionality
  - **`bwc mcp info <server>`** - View detailed server information
  - **`bwc mcp status`** - Check Docker MCP Gateway status

  ### Installation Scopes

  - **User Scope** (default) - Install for current user across all projects
  - **Project Scope** - Install for current project only (version controlled)

  ### Docker MCP Gateway Integration

  - ‚úÖ Automatic Docker Desktop detection
  - ‚úÖ Secure API key configuration
  - ‚úÖ One-click server enablement
  - ‚úÖ Unified gateway for all clients

  ## Why Docker MCP Gateway Only?

  We exclusively use Docker MCP Gateway for security:

  - üîí **Container Isolation** - Complete system protection
  - üîë **Secure Secrets** - Docker Desktop manages all API keys
  - üåê **Single Endpoint** - One gateway for all MCP servers
  - ‚úÖ **Verified Images** - All servers are signed and verified

  ## Usage

  ```bash
  # Prerequisites: Install Docker Desktop
  # https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop

  # List available MCP servers
  bwc mcp list

  # Install for user (all projects)
  bwc add --mcp postgres

  # Install for project (team sharing)
  bwc add --mcp postgres --project

  # Configure with API key
  $ bwc add --mcp supabase
  ? Installation scope?
    ‚ùØ User (all projects)
      Project (this project only)
  ? Enter your Supabase access token: ****
  ‚úì Enabled in Docker MCP Gateway
  ```

  ## Installation Scopes Explained

  **User Scope** (stored in `~/.bwc/config.json`):

  - Servers available across all projects
  - Personal API keys stored securely
  - Not shared with team

  **Project Scope** (stored in `./bwc.config.json`):

  - Servers specific to project
  - Configuration in version control
  - Team members use same servers
  - API keys via environment variables

  ## Breaking Changes

  None - MCP support is additive and doesn't affect existing functionality.
